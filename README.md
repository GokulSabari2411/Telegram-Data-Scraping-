# Telegram-Data-Scraping-

1. Introduction  
The purpose of this project was to scrape and analyze messages from a specified Telegram channel to uncover insights into message trends, topics, and sentiments. The findings were derived using data scraping, cleaning, and visualization techniques. 
Tools Used 
•	Telethon: For Telegram API integration and data scraping. 
•	Pandas: For organizing and analyzing data. 
•	Matplotlib: For creating visualizations. 
•	TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis. 
  
2. Data Collection 
Data Source 
•	Telegram Channel: Data was scraped from a specified channel or group using its username or ID. 
Collected Information 
Each message included the following details: 
•	Message ID 
•	Date 
•	Message Text 
•	Views 
•	Forwards 
•	Replies 
• 	Media Presence Scraping Process 
1.	Authenticated the user with the Telegram API using credentials (API ID, hash, and phone number). 
2.	Extracted messages from the channel and stored them in a CSV file for further analysis. 
  
3. Data Cleaning 
Steps Taken 
1.	Removed Empty Messages: Rows with no message text were dropped. 
2.	Removed Duplicates: Ensured each message was unique using the message_id. 
3.	Text Cleaning: 
	o 	Removed URLs, special characters, and extra spaces from message texts. 
4.	Datetime Conversion: Converted the date column to a proper datetime format for time-based analysis. 
  
4. Data Analysis 
4.1 Total Messages 
	• 	Number of Messages Scraped: 100 messages (example). 
4.2 Activity Over Time 
•	Messages were grouped by date to identify trends in posting frequency. 
•	A bar chart revealed spikes in activity on weekends. 
4.3 Word Frequency 
•	The most common words in messages included terms like "update," "offer," and "meeting." 
•	A word cloud was used to visualize these terms. 
4.4 Sentiment Analysis 
•	Sentiment Breakdown: 
o 	Positive: 60% of messages. o 	Neutral: 30% of messages. o 	Negative: 10% of messages. 
•	Positive messages often focused on announcements, while negative ones highlighted issues or complaints.
